# Front-end Developer 
This repo was created as a test for a job offer.

## Description
I made the Layout with css/Sass, I also used font-awesome for the icons and finally I used the Vue.js framework to do the interaction.
The project was updated, now I'm using webpack for Sass, Js and Vue using their loaders and babel for a right interpretation.

You can see what I used for this refactoring at package.json.

## Usage

After "Git clone" you can see the project running in index.html, app.css and app.js are the main files, I pushed them as production but if you want to edit the project I'm using the [webpackdev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server), so inside the project folder in the terminal run **"npm install"** for dependencies and use the command **"npx webpack-dev-server"**  to set up a server and edit the project.
